## TPSA Workshop

Process Mining has been successfully applied in analysing and improving processes based on event logs in all kinds of environments. However, aspects of trust, privacy and security have been largely neglected when considering the technical design as well as the organizational application of Process Mining. These aspects can be seen from two perspectives: 

**(A) Responsible application of Process Mining** and the trust that the methods and their results cannot or are not misued. Criteria for responsible data science have been defined, e.g., the FACT (Fairness, Accuracy, Confidentiality, Transparency) criteria. How should these criteria be embedded in the design and the application of Process Mining methods.

**(B) Investigating privacy and security** aspects of information systems by using Process Mining methods. How can Process Mining be used to find privacy violations or security issues that undermine the trust in systems. 

For us, **privacy** relates to the concern that event logs may contain personal data of both customers and employees and the challenge of protecting the information about individuals while still being useful for process mining (e.g., differential privacy, k-anonymity, homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computing). However, Process Mining could also be used to investigate whether privacy regulations are being followed and pinpoint compliance violations. Often, **security** aspects (e.g., encryption) are closely connected when processing personal data cannot be avoided. On the other hand, the workshop is about the concept of **trust**, which is required both from the perspective of trust in organisational and technological measures that event logs are not misused (e.g., for worker surveillance) as well as from the perspective of trust that the results of a process mining analysis faithfully reflect reality (e.g., data quality, traceability, auditibility).

The main objective of the TPPA workshop is to give a forum for the trust, privacy, and secruity aspects and the responsible application of process mining including other concerns such as fairness, transparency, and accuracy. We invite researchers and industry to share their research, ideas, experience reports, and challenges in this area. The topics of interest for tis workshop, but not limited to, are provided below.
