## Panel 'Trust and Privacy in Process Analytics

In the context of the 1st Workshop on Trust and Privacy in Process Analytics (TPPA) at the 2nd International Conference on Process Mining (ICPM), we are organizing a virtual panel discussion on the topic of Trust and Privacy in Process Analytics. We have four participants with a wide experience in both Process Mining applications and research.
