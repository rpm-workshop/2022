The program of the TPSA workshop includes two sessions: Full papers (accepted to the proceedings), and extended abstracts (presentation only). The workshop will take place in-person at ICPM in Eindhoven. In case none of the authors of an accepted paper can travel to Eindhoven due to COVID restrictions, we are going to facilitate a remote attendance. Please consult with the ICPM organizers regarding the options. The registration page of ICPM is here:
